# Ultimate Launcher

A simple  tool for loading and launching programs and disk/cartridge images on a Ultimate 1541 equipped C64 (or an Ultimate 64) directly from the comfort of your desktop. Turn your disks in style.

## Prerequisites

Ultimate Launcher needs .NET 6 and an Ultimate-II+ or 64 connected to the network.

## Usage

First, enter the IP address or host name of your Ultimate cartridge/64. From then on, you can select a directory at the top, and mount or run any PRGs, D64s or CRTs with the two buttons on the right.

### Command line interface / Conduit

Specify a relative or absolute directory or image file as command line parameter to automatically launch it (a directory will set the launcher's current directory).

If you're using Gargaj's [Conduit](https://github.com/gargaj/Conduit/) you can set the Ultimate Launcher as VICE executable - enjoy single click demo watching directly from Pouet, Demozoo or even the CSDB :)
